# ArtGeneration
The data used for this project is from WikiArt.org which is a non-profit project containing both public domain and copyright protected artworks. The goal of WikiArt.org is to create an area where art is accessible to anyone around the world, and features artwork from over 3000 artists, 250,000 individual pieces and localized on 8 languages. In particular, the dataset came from Artificial Intelligence researcher Chee Seng Chan and his colleagues where they trained a deep convolutional Network for Fine-art Paintings Classification. For this project, I took 5 different kinds of collections of photos and fed them into the same Generative Adversarial Network being a collection of minimalist photos, a collection of pop art photos, a collection of Baroque photos, a collection of cat faces from a Kaggle dataset, and a collection of Bob Ross photos dataset.
